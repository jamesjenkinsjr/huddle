## Description
Huddle was created to solve a simple problem: easily accessible lines of communication without a need to make new accounts, give out personal information, or worry about leaving someone out.

With Huddle, everyone with your unique Huddle room link (generated using a V4 UUID) can immediately provide basic, private information and jump into the conversation. No more forwarded emails, massive laggy text message groups, or social media friend requests. Simply generate a huddle room, provide the link to anyone, and get started being productive!
